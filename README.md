# simpleHTTPServer with Node.js

Poor attempt to replicate the terminal usage of the Python module SimpleHTTPServer.

## Needed
* Web browser
* node.js

## Run with default settings
`$ node simpleHTTPServer.js`

## View help, usage and options
`$ node simpleHTTPServer.js --help`

## Application description
Similar to Pyhton's SimpleHTTPServer (`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)

### Bad style
Don't care about the mashup with " " and ' ' for now.
